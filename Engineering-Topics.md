# Here is Some Topic I learned 


1. Learning is my responsibility, I don't always have to rely on a teacher to give me all the information,
   I have to search and learn on my own.

2. The importance of time and not wasting it on busy things that do not help me with the goal of busyness only     
   without focusing on my real goal and what I want to accomplish.

    ## "Extremely successful people don’t tolerate busywork or distraction. They have crystal clear vision on their goals, and do what they need to do to get there, every single day."


3. Focus with whatever you do to have incredible productivity!

    ## “When you have less time available for work, you have to make better choices about what to work on (and what not to).” -Tim Metz


4. Problem solving:
     what should I do when I encounter a new problem?
     * Understand.
     * Plan.
     * Divide.
     * Stuck?
         - Debug.
         -  starting anew : Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes.
         - Research.
     * Practice.
