   ### CRUD : CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE

       When we are building APIs, we want our models to provide four basic types of functionality. The model must be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete resources. Computer scientists often refer to these functions by the acronym CRUD. A model should have the ability to perform at most these four functions in order to be complete. If an action cannot be described by one of these four operations, then it should potentially be a model of its own.


  ### CRUD AND REST
       In a REST environment, CRUD often corresponds to the HTTP methods POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE, respectively. These are the fundamental elements of a persistent storage system.

     Throughout the rest of the article, we will recommend standards and response codes that are typically followed by developers when creating RESTful applications. Conventions may differ so feel free to experiment with different return values and codes as you become comfortable with the CRUD paradigm.

     Imagine we are working with a system that is keeping track of meals and their corresponding prices for a restaurant. Letâ€™s look at how we would implement CRUD operations.

  ### NoSQL

      A NoSQL (originally referring to "non SQL" or "non relational") database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but the name "NoSQL" was only coined in the early 21st century,triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies. NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL systems are also sometimes called "Not only SQL" to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages, or sit alongside SQL databases in polyglot persistent architectures.

   - Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.
