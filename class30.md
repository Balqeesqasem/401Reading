## Redux 

    - Redux is one of the hottest libraries in front-end development.
    - Redux maintains the state of an entire application in a single immutable state tree
    - The Redux DevTools make it easy to trace when, where, why, and how your application's state changed.
    - Redux's architecture lets you log changes, use "time-travel debugging", and even send complete error reports to a 
      server.  


## the steps to use Redux: 
      - install redux.
      - import createStore use reducer as a store
      - createStore(reducer), state and action pass on reducer.
      - Store.getState() will return the current state of your application.
