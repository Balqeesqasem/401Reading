# HTTP

 - HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It's a stateless, application-layer protocol for communicating between distributed systems, and is the foundation of the modern web. As a web developer, we all must have a strong understanding of this protocol.

 - HTTP allows for communication between a variety of hosts and clients, and supports a mixture of network configurations.

 ### HTTP Request
   - A HTTP/1.1 request is formatted in text and transferred using TCP. The first line of the request contains the method, URL, and HTTP Version.

  - A header is a key value pair separated using a colon. Headers containing more than one value separate each value using a semicolon.

 ### HTTP Response
   - A HTTP/1.1 response is also formatted in text and transferred using TCP.

   - The first line of the response contains the HTTP VERSION, STATUS CODE, and STATUS MESSAGE.

   - The header section of the request is terminated with an empty line. An optional body follows the header section.

  - A RESTful Endpoint” is a URI that identifies the resource. When addressed with a proper method, you are able to effect state. In normal terms, this means “Performing CRUD operations over HTTP
