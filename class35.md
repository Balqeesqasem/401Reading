# AngularJS

 - AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. It is fully extensible
   and works well with other libraries. Every feature can be modified or replaced to suit your unique development workflow and feature needs.

 - Angular puts you in control over scalability. Meet huge data requirements by building data models on RxJS, Immutable,
   js or another push-model.

            - Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
